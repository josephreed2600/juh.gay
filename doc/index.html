<p>hi</p>
<p>it’s a juh</p>
<p>i live here now</p>
<h2 id="so-you-finally-made-it-to-the-late-90s-huh">so you finally made
it to the late 90s huh?</h2>
<p>I’ve wanted to put up a personal site for a while, but today I am
avoiding vacuuming, so it’s actually getting done! I used to do things,
but now I work for a fortune 10 company and don’t do them anymore. I
enjoy doing CAD and often <a

Lake City, UT</a>. these have broken somewhat since the furniture models
have been updated, and mates will not be repaired. end of life.) I used
to have <a
href="javascript:alert(%22haven&#39;t%20written%20that%20article%20yet,%20click%20me%20again%20later%20:%5B%22)">strong
feelings about the web</a>, but they’ve been replaced with numb
disappointment in web developers.</p>
<p>I’m exceedingly lazy, with the caveat that I’m willing to do more of
fun work in order to avoid doing less of boring work (the <a
href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">well-explored</a> <a
href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">engineer’s conundrum</a>). Maybe I’ll
write about things I’m pretending to work on someday. They’re all right
here in my notes; maybe I can export the whole canvas to the web nightly
or something. That might be cool!</p>
<h2
id="but-juh-you-said-you-used-to-do-things-surely-you-must-use-linux-who-is-this-guy">but
juh, you said you used to do things? surely you must use linux? who is
this guy?</h2>
<p>well, ok, yeah, so…</p>
<ul>
<li>using thinkpads p1g2 for personal and x1cg7 for work, but i don’t
really like them all that much</li>
<li>manjaro is my daily driver (but i’ve been burned by arch things
enough that i’m sticking to debians and containers for all new
deployments)</li>
<li>i3 and kitty-term and fish and vim</li>
<li>docker, docker compose, traefik</li>
<li>used to do a little math, like <a
href="https://github.com/Team1323/2018PowerUp-VSC/tree/master/src/main/java/com/team1323/lib/math/vectors">partially
implementing</a> a <a

path-following algorithm</a> for a particular <a
href="files/OCILOW_Control.pdf">holonomic drivetrain</a> (i did some
navigation/telemetry code too)</li>
<li>used to build stuff in PHP, basic crud applications for an FRC team
back in high school</li>
<li>used to build stuff in JS, all kinds of cursed shit the second time
i was in college</li>
<li>used to build stuff in <code>dc</code>, all kinds of <a
href="https://github.com/josephreed2600/dc-lib-namespaces/blob/master/matrix.dc">cursed
shit</a> the first time i was in college</li>
<li>hell, i even used to build stuff in css, like this <a
href="https://bonkstrap.jtreed.org/styles.html">silly framework</a> i
made for an assignment</li>
<li>used to use git, and <a
href="https://github.com/josephreed2600/git-cheatsheet/tree/master/reference">tried
to explain it</a> for one of my roommates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thats-a-lot-of-things-you-dont-do-anymore">that’s a lot of
things you don’t do anymore</h2>
<p>yeah. here are some things i’m working on or learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>doing more with docker, including trying to move my daily driver to
<a href="https://kasmweb.com/">Kasm Workspaces</a> (there’s a line of
yaks out the door, we’ll get there). gpus are hell</li>
<li>learning basic EE things, hoping to someday do less-basic EE
things</li>
<li>visiting a doctor soon!</li>
<li>setting up the garage i can’t afford in the bedroom i don’t use, for
servers, resin printing, soldering, probing, and rebuilding my jeep</li>
<li>oh yeah i have a jeep :) like most of my friends, it’s cute but it
doesn’t work :(
<ul>
<li>need to rebuild the transfer case</li>
</ul></li>
<li>i’d like to get into kubernetes</li>
<li>i’d also like to get into bare metal orchestration, which is
obviously a horrific battlefield of incompatible technologies and
partially-implemented standards and vendors being stupid and ancient
open-source projects and</li>
</ul>
<p>here are some things i recommend to you, stranger:</p>
<ul>
<li>working with web frontend? <a
href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">grow some
principles!</a></li>
<li>buy some <a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B06VVBW9BQ">whiteboards</a>
for your home. adhd lifesavers. my god they have changed everything.
you’ll need <a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0006HXJFK">markers</a>
too</li>
<li>keep your water bottle where you can see it. if i can’t see it i
just forget to drink water</li>
<li>a jeep should not be your only vehicle</li>
<li>resin printing is a small but odiferous nightmare, don’t get into it
unless you have plenty of space to dedicate to a large grow tent or fume
hood. ventilate it. give yourself extra room to work and protect your
surfaces. also wear gloves and be careful</li>
<li>acetone will eat through vinyl gloves, so <a
href="http://amo-csd.lbl.gov/downloads/Chemical%20Resistance%20of%20Gloves.pdf">choose
something else</a> (latex or butyl) if you’re working with it. that’s
unrelated to the resin printing comments; you should be using
isopropanol for resin washing</li>
</ul>
<p>here’s where i can remember being in the US:</p>
<ul>
<li>WA: lived in battleground, everett, enumclaw, federal way; visited
auburn, bainbridge, pasco, poulsbo; worked in seattle, tukwila, redmond,
kirkland</li>
<li>CA: lived in roseville, lincoln, madera; studied in fresno; visited
jamestown, san diego, playa vista, monterey; worked in los angeles, just
up the street from the guy with the knife at that bus station</li>
<li>UT: lived in salt lake city, west jordan; visited midvale, ogden,
orem, provo, west valley; worked in bluffdale</li>

</ul>
<p>here’s where i’ve been outside the US:</p>
<ul>
<li>this unordered list intentionally left empty</li>
</ul>
<p>here’s where i’d like to go:</p>
<ul>
<li>japan: <a

(not <a
href="https://google.com/search?q=okonomiyaki&amp;tbm=isch">okonomiyaki</a>),
rainy season, pretty trees and stuff</li>
<li>a forest, very green and lush and damp</li>
<li>back to bed</li>
<li>museums, especially the rocket ones in florida :D</li>

<p>you’re welcome to trigger anxiety by messaging me out of the

data-cites="you.jtreed.org">@you.jtreed.org</span></li>
<li>discord available upon request, i use it but it’s an easy target for
spam so i don’t think i’ll publish it on the web</li>
<li>if you call me i will not answer :)</li>
</ul>
<p>now for the fun part of having one of these sites: linking to other
