hi

it's a juh

i live here now

## so you finally made it to the late 90s huh?

I've wanted to put up a personal site for a while, but today I am avoiding vacuuming, so it's actually getting done! I used to do things, but now I work for a fortune 10 company and don't do them anymore. I enjoy doing CAD and often [remodel my apartment virtually](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a32da81864fb3dced7ec7620/w/d3ce550bd492d192e2e8eb86/e/6da772219dbf235262aa5318?renderMode=0&uiState=63deb410b8881564bb6ac776) (past apartments available: [West Jordan, UT](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/43ed18864c0305f6b35d1683/w/39b7d1707e4e913047e672ae/e/6dd00693b0d179ea94225a9d?renderMode=0&uiState=63dee471ae8df61f88d1554c); [Salt Lake City, UT](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c07a195d16f197590e843701/w/d9c1401df6eb9d5dbd8b163a/e/de4efed6f0e6eca29c039646?configuration=default&renderMode=0&uiState=63dee62f42505f2326554d89). these have broken somewhat since the furniture models have been updated, and mates will not be repaired. end of life.) I used to have [strong feelings about the web](javascript:alert("haven't written that article yet, click me again later :[")), but they've been replaced with numb disappointment in web developers.

I'm exceedingly lazy, with the caveat that I'm willing to do more of fun work in order to avoid doing less of boring work (the [well-explored](https://xkcd.com/1205/) [engineer's conundrum](https://xkcd.com/1319/)). Maybe I'll write about things I'm pretending to work on someday. They're all right here in my notes; maybe I can export the whole canvas to the web nightly or something. That might be cool!

## but juh, you said you used to do things? surely you must use linux? who is this guy?

well, ok, yeah, so...

- using thinkpads p1g2 for personal and x1cg7 for work, but i don't really like them all that much
- manjaro is my daily driver (but i've been burned by arch things enough that i'm sticking to debians and containers for all new deployments)
- i3 and kitty-term and fish and vim
- docker, docker compose, traefik, nginx
- used to do a little math, like [partially implementing](https://github.com/Team1323/2018PowerUp-VSC/tree/master/src/main/java/com/team1323/lib/math/vectors) a [guiding vector field path-following algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.04391.pdf) for a particular [holonomic drivetrain](files/OCILOW_Control.pdf) (i did some navigation/telemetry code too)
- used to build stuff in PHP, basic crud applications for an FRC team back in high school
- used to build stuff in JS, all kinds of cursed shit the second time i was in college
- used to build stuff in `dc`, all kinds of [cursed shit](https://github.com/josephreed2600/dc-lib-namespaces/blob/master/matrix.dc) the first time i was in college
- hell, i even used to build stuff in css, like this [silly framework](https://bonkstrap.jtreed.org/styles.html) i made for an assignment
- used to use git, and [tried to explain it](https://github.com/josephreed2600/git-cheatsheet/tree/master/reference) for one of my roommates
- used to burn dinosaurs in my jeep
	- oh yeah i have a jeep :) like many of my friends, it's very cute but also broken :(

## that's a lot of things you don't do anymore

yeah... sometimes i feel down about it, but i'm trying to [do more things](/projects)! and in the process of building this site, I have learned many things, and I have built a nice little [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jtreed/semistatic-nginx/) for auto-pulling your git repos and dumping them into nginx tidily :)

## wow juh, you are so cool and i want to talk to you

you're welcome to trigger my anxiety by messaging me out of the blue:

- juh@libera, jtreed secondary
- juh.gay+\<your handle here\>@you.jtreed.org
- discord available upon request, i use it but it's an easy target for spam so i don't think i'll publish it on the web
- if you call me i will not answer :)

now for the fun part of having one of these sites: linking to other people!
