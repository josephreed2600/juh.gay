hi

it's a juh

i live here now

i've wanted to put up a personal site for a while, but today i am avoiding vacuuming, so it's actually getting done! i used to do things, but now i work for a fortune 10 company and don't do them anymore. i enjoy doing cad and often [remodel my apartment virtually](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a32da81864fb3dced7ec7620/w/d3ce550bd492d192e2e8eb86/e/6da772219dbf235262aa5318?renderMode=0&uiState=63deb410b8881564bb6ac776) (past apartments available: [West Jordan, UT](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/43ed18864c0305f6b35d1683/w/39b7d1707e4e913047e672ae/e/6dd00693b0d179ea94225a9d?renderMode=0&uiState=63dee471ae8df61f88d1554c); [Salt Lake City, UT](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c07a195d16f197590e843701/w/d9c1401df6eb9d5dbd8b163a/e/de4efed6f0e6eca29c039646?configuration=default&renderMode=0&uiState=63dee62f42505f2326554d89). these have broken somewhat since the furniture models have been updated, and mates will not be repaired. end of life.) i used to have [strong feelings about the web](javascript:alert("sorry, haven't written that article yet, click me again later :("))), but they've been replaced with numb disappointment in web developers.

i'm exceedingly lazy, with the caveat that i'm willing to do more of fun work in order to avoid doing less of boring work (the [well-explored](https://xkcd.com/1205/) [engineer's conundrum](https://xkcd.com/1319/)). maybe i'll write about things i'm pretending to work on someday. they're all right here in my notes, maybe i can export the whole canvas to the web nightly or something. that might be cool!

> but juh, you said you used to do things? surely you must use linux? who is this guy?

well, ok, yeah, so...
- using thinkpads p1g2 for personal and x1cg7 for work, but i don't really like them all that much
- manjaro is my daily driver (but i've been burned by arch things enough that i'm sticking to debians and containers for all new deployments)
- i3 and kitty-term and fish and vim
- docker, docker compose, traefik
- used to do a little math, like [partially implementing](https://github.com/Team1323/2018PowerUp-VSC/tree/master/src/main/java/com/team1323/lib/math/vectors) a [guiding vector field path-following algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.04391.pdf) for a particular [holonomic drivetrain](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/uploads/default/original/3X/9/7/970e68af0ec443c2efb3e477ea3d1ffc4c99fa55.pdf) (i did some navigation/telemetry code too) # FIXME don't hotlink
- used to build stuff in PHP, basic crud applications for an FRC team back in high school
- used to build stuff in JS, all kinds of cursed shit the second time i was in college
- used to build stuff in `dc`, all kinds of [cursed shit](https://github.com/josephreed2600/dc-lib-namespaces/blob/master/matrix.dc) the first time i was in college
- used to use git, and [tried to explain it](https://github.com/josephreed2600/git-cheatsheet/tree/master/reference) for one of my roommates

some things i'm working on or learning:
- doing more with docker, including trying to move my daily driver to [Kasm Workspaces](https://kasmweb.com/) (there's a line of yaks out the door, we'll get there). gpus are hell
- learning basic EE things, hoping to someday do less-basic EE things
- visiting a doctor soon!
- setting up the garage i can't afford in the bedroom i don't use, for servers, resin printing, soldering, probing, and rebuilding my jeep
- oh yeah i have a jeep :) like most of my friends, it's cute but it doesn't work :(
	- need to rebuild the transfer case
- i'd like to get into kubernetes
- i'd also like to get into bare metal orchestration, which is obviously a horrific battlefield of incompatible technologies and partially-implemented standards and vendors being stupid and ancient open-source projects and

here are some things i recommend to you, stranger:
- working with web frontend? [grow some principles!](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
- buy some [whiteboards](https://amazon.com/dp/B06VVBW9BQ) for your home. adhd lifesavers. my god they have changed everything. you'll need [markers](https://amazon.com/dp/B0006HXJFK) too
- keep your water bottle where you can see it. if i can't see it i just forget to drink water
- a jeep should not be your only vehicle
- resin printing is a small but odiferous nightmare, don't get into it unless you have plenty of space to dedicate to a large grow tent or fume hood. ventilate it. give yourself extra room to work and protect your surfaces. also wear gloves and be careful
- acetone will eat through vinyl gloves, so [choose something else](http://amo-csd.lbl.gov/downloads/Chemical%20Resistance%20of%20Gloves.pdf) (latex or butyl) if you're working with it. that's unrelated to the resin printing comments; you should be using isopropanol for resin washing

here's where i can remember being in the US:

- NV: visited reno, tahoe
- MN: visited minneapolis

- AK: visited seward, anchorage, denali

here's where i've been outside the US:
- this unordered list intentionally left empty

here's where i'd like to go:
- japan: [pancakes](https://google.com/search?q=japanese+pancakes&tbm=isch) (not [okonomiyaki](https://google.com/search?q=okonomiyaki&tbm=isch)), rainy season, pretty trees and stuff
- a forest, very green and lush and damp
- back to bed
- museums, especially the rocket ones in florida :D

- discord available upon request, i use it but it's an easy target for spam so i don't think i'll publish it on the web

now for the fun part of having one of these sites: linking to other people!
